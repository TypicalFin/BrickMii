# BrickMii
Simple Wii homebrew app that bricks your console.</br>
Code quality is quite poor as I have limited experience in C.</br>
</br>
The UI (if you can even call it that) is currently ready.</br>
The actual bricking functionality is currently awaiting implementation.</br>

## Methods
- [Banner brick](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Brick/Banner_brick)</br>
- [Mail brick](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Brick/Mail_brick)</br>
- [Error 003 brick](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Error_003)</br>
- [System menu brick](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Brick/System_Menu_brick)</br>

Other methods will also be added.

## How to use
You really shouldn't. Do you really want to turn your precious Wii into a paperweight?</br>
